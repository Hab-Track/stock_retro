  "22snake01.text": "Welcome to Snake, the game you know and love from your mom's Nokia phone! Right now, you're on the first level of the noob difficulty.\\n\\nThere are 5 difficulty stages, and a total of 36 levels. At each difficulty stage, you'll be awarded a cool badge, and upon completing the hardest difficulty stage, you will receive a unique snake trophy (untradeable). The trophy can be earned once every 5 days per user.\\n\\nHow to play:\\n\\nStep on the arrow plates to get in the queue. As soon as it's your turn, you can control the snake with the 4 arrow plates. Each level has a unique objective, and different mechanics will be unveiled as you explore all of them.\\n\\nMost levels are cleared when a certain score is reached, or when the snake steps on a green color tile. Some levels are cleared automatically when you survive long enough.\\n\\nYou will receive specific instructions per level as you walk on the queue's rollers. You will also get a time limit. If you can't make the level in that time, you will lose and need to try again. The time limit is very generous 90% of the time.\\n\\nCheckpoints\\n\\nNeed to log off but haven't finished the game yet? No worries! You can restart your latest difficulty by going back to the latest checkpoint you visited under owner: *snakemaster42* in the navigator. The checkpoints use leaderboards to track how many times you won!",

Count yourself among the few lucky ones to have made it this far!\\n\\nYou didn't think you were anywhere close to finishing, right? This is the boss level of impossible mode after all. The first 35 levels were barely practice for what's to come! It's hard to hold back my evil laughter while typing this text, because I know the suffering from what's to come… Don't tell Fresh Staff, but I was only able to finish this level once when creating this game.\\n\\nBut not to worry, you're in a different situation. After all, you're fighting to get the most epic snake badge of all… Missing out on some sleep won't be an issue for you, right?\\n\\nAre you up for the challenge?\\n\\nThis level is exactly like level 1 of the noob difficulty. The only difference being: you need to reach score 225, which is close to the maximum length of the snake.\\n\\nThe longer  the snake gets, the more you need to be careful about how you're moving the snake. You need to leave enough space for food to spawn. Snake food will never spawn directly next to a snake body part, so you need to make sure there are empty areas.\\n\\nAlso be careful about how you move around as you get bigger, because once you've surrounded yourself, there may be no way out.\\n\\nThe trick is to take it slow! The time limit for this level is 80 minutes, which is an insane overestimation of the actual time you need, so you've got more than enough time!\\n\\nIn this room, chat has been disabled for visitors to make sure you're not disturbed.\\n\\nIs someone else already playing this level? Not to worry, this level has been duplicated 5 times, so you never have to stand in the queue! Step on the red color tile to play a copy of this level!\\n\\nGood luck!",
