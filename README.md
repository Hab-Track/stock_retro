## Viewing Large Diffs

Sometimes, diffs can be too large to render directly on github
In such cases, you can append `.patch` to the commit URL to view the changes in a more lightweight format

For example:\
https://github.com/Hab-Track/stock_retro/commit/ac85d8fa6d9be27e8dafc02b629a9e6156a4e594 \
becomes:\
https://github.com/Hab-Track/stock_retro/commit/ac85d8fa6d9be27e8dafc02b629a9e6156a4e594.patch
